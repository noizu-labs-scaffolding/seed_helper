# AGENTS.md — seed_helper

Guidance for **Codex**, **Grok**, **Cursor**, and other `AGENTS.md` / `AGENT.md` tools.

Claude Code loads [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). Same policy; this file is the harness-shaped sibling (numbered MUST first, markdown headings). If both this file and a parent `AGENTS.md` load, **this file wins on conflict**.

## MUST (every turn)

1. **Trinity Protocol REQUIRED**: Orientation → Friction → Response (full text: monorepo `protocols/the-trinity-protocol.md`).
2. **No shell in main thread** — delegate to taskers.
3. **Worktrees (REQUIRED)**: canonical placement `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`, created from this repo's own `.git` off `develop`; `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored — see **Worktrees — Canonical Convention** below.
4. **Worktrees (REQUIRED)**: canonical placement `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`, created from this repo's own `.git` off `develop`; `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored — see **Worktrees — Canonical Convention** below.
5. **PRs target `develop`.** Never merge or push `main` (CI/CD-only release path).

## Identity

Guidance for Claude Code. Monorepo ops → `../../../../../CLAUDE.md` (trl-infra root).

## Identity

Elixir seeding helper from the noizu-labs-scaffolding family, used by app seed/liquibase flows (e.g. promptornot, pos_app). Utility lib — keep minimal and additive.

## Stack & Commands

Elixir. `mix deps.get && mix compile`; `mix test`; `mix format`, `mix credo`.

## Gotchas

- Raw SQL paths: strict `PostgrexTypes` **rejects string uuids** — cast properly.
- Seed ordering matters for consumers' Liquibase/Ecto flows — document any new seed stages.

## Branch & PR Policy

- Submodules sit on **`develop`** — keep your checkout on `develop`.
- All PRs target **`develop`** (feature/bug/task branches fork from `develop`).
- **`main` is CI/CD-only**: CI/CD automation performs all merges into `main` (release path). Never merge to or push `main` by hand.

## Worktrees — Canonical Convention (REQUIRED)

All work happens on git worktrees, created from **this repo's own `.git`** — never work directly on a shared checkout of `develop`/`main`.

- **Placement (fixed):** every worktree lives inside this repo's checkout at **`.claude/worktrees/<name>/`** — never siblings (`<repo>.worktrees/`), never ad-hoc paths. Matches Claude Code's native worktree tooling, so harness-created and manual worktrees coexist.
- **Naming:** `<name>` = branch name with `/` → `-` (branch `feature/vfs-wave1` → `.claude/worktrees/feature-vfs-wave1`).
- **Creation** — from this repo's own `.git`, based on `develop` (never `main`):

  ```bash
  git -C <this-repo> worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b <branch> develop
  ```

- **Hygiene:** `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored in this repo; never commit its contents. One worktree per task; remove it when the work lands (`git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<name>` — keep the branch).
- **Addressing:** `git -C <this-repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name> …`; verify branch + clean index before any git write; no `git stash`.
- **Elixir projects:** the MAIN checkout owns `deps/` + `_build/`; each worktree symlinks `deps` (and `_build` where needed) to the canonical checkout by **absolute path** — no per-worktree re-fetch/recompile.
- **Legacy placements** (`.worktrees/`, `.wt/`, `<repo>.worktrees/` siblings, `staging/`) are grandfathered — do not create new ones; migrate opportunistically. `staging/` remains local-only experiments (never pushed/submoduled).
